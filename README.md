Usage
-----

### Requirements

Running the Origami Set module requires [Node.js] 6.x and [npm]. You can install with:

```sh
npm install @financial-times/origami-image-set-tools
```

### Command-Line Interface

This module exposes an `oist` command which doesn't do anything yet.

### API Documentation

This library makes use of [promises], and provides a wrapper around part of [S3] â€“ familiarity is assumed in the rest of the API documentation. You'll also need to require the module with:

```js
const OrigamiImageSetTools = require('@financial-times/origami-image-set-tools');
```

#### `new OrigamiImageSetTools( [options] )`

This function returns a new Origami Image Set Tools instance. You can configure the created tool set with [an options object](#options) if you need to override any defaults.

```js
const toolSet = new OrigamiImageSetTools({
    example: 'value'
});
```

#### `toolSet.generateImageSetManifest()`

This function returns a promise which resolves with generated image set manifest. This uses the `baseDirectory` and `sourceDirectory` [options](#options) to determine where to find images.

The image manifest has the following format:

```js
{
    // The directory the images were sourced from
    sourceDirectory: 'src',

    // A list of the found images
    images: [

        // The name, extension, and full path of each image
        {
            name: 'myimage',
            extension: 'svg',
            path: 'src/myimage.svg'
        }

    ]
}
```

#### `toolSet.generateImageSetManifestFile()`

This function returns a promise which generates image set information (using `generateImageSetManifest`) then saves it to a file as JSON.

This uses the `baseDirectory` and `sourceDirectory` [options](#options) to determine where to find images and where to save the file. The file will be created at `<baseDirectory>/imageset.json`.

#### Options

The Origami Image Set Tools module can be configured with a variety of options, passed in as an object to the `OrigamiImageSetTools` function. The available options are as follows:

  - `baseDirectory`: The base directory of the image set, where the manifest files sit. Image set JSON files will be created here. Defaults to the current working directory
  - `log`: A console object used to output non-request logs. Defaults to the global `console` object
  - `sourceDirectory`: The directory relative to `baseDirectory` where the actual image files are located. Defaults to `"src"`


Contributing
